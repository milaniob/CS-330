# CS-330


This class has been very helpful on my approach to designing software. The ability to have 3d images of my code has allowed me to get a better perspective on the code I write. OpenGL has given me great practice on creating modular code, and being able to see results of altering that modular code easily. I had to learn new and better ways to structure and comment my code. There were a lot of repeating methods and methods with a lot of coordinates in them. This was create practice in commenting a large amount of code. Overall, this class has helped me a lot towards my future goals. As I continue to study game development in my coming classes and through personal projects, getting this ground level view of models and world environments has been great. I get to see a lot of the base logic involved and even though game development engines help skip a lot of this process, this will help me troubleshoot and create functions of my own.
